TIC TAC TOE project:
  - determines X wins
  - determines O wins
  - determines ties
  - determines resigns 
  - save a count of X wins, O wins, and ties 
    - displays most up to date data once the game has ended. (for this version at least)

  Next steps:
- AI to play against 
    - Min- Max algorithm to determine most optimal placement
      - two modes easy and hard. Easy does not take depth of the move into account. Hard does.
    In another repo

        - has 2 player functions on same phone or AI opponent
        - and records page.
